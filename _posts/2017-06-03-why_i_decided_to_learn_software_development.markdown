Until rather recently, software development was not on my mind. I majored in Ecology and Evolution and was preparing to apply to either dental school or medical school. I am not particularly interested in either fields but there is not much you can really do with a biology degree. However, during my last semester, which started at the beginning of this year, I took a genetics course and had to learn a little bit of coding and how to use Linux. Initially, I was not thrilled about this because I thought coding would be tedious and boring. But after the first couple weeks, I was truly enjoying the coding aspects of the class and deided to look more into coding and began considering it as a career. 

This is when I began playing around of CodeAcademy just to see what it is like and, as it turned out, I enjoyed it very much. So I started looking for classes I could take to learn more and discovered the various coding bootcamps that exitst. After reading reviews on Switchup, I decided that Flatiron would be a good choice for me and applied and somehow got in even though I did not think I did all that well on the technical interview. And here I am now and I am very excited to start this part of my life!
